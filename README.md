# FLMulti
The ultimate goal of FLMulti is to allow creators to collaborate on one FL project at the same time.<br><br>

This is still work in progress so this COULD be a reality, check back here when its closer to release.

## Phase 1:
Connect two FL Studio instances over local network - 🟡 (WIP)
Connect over the internet via a relay server
